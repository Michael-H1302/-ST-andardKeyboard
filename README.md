A custom keyboard design made with KiCad. The Design uses a STM32 Blue Pill Microcontroller featuring red led backlight that can be controlled in three groups (two rows per group). 
The keyboard design supports standard mechanical switches like the Cherry MX and the Gateron. Due to the LED placement below the actual switch footprint, even switches without an
extra space for the LED are supported.
